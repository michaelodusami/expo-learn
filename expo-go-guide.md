### Expo Go: A Comprehensive Guide

---

#### **What Is Expo Go?**

Expo Go is a mobile application that lets developers preview and test React Native apps during the development process. It's part of the **Expo ecosystem**, which simplifies building and deploying cross-platform mobile applications.

Expo Go allows developers to instantly view changes they make to their app's code on a real device without needing to compile or install the app each time. It's designed to speed up development by removing many of the complexities associated with setting up and testing mobile apps.

- **Platforms:** Available for Android and iOS.

#### **What Is Expo Go in Layman's Terms?**

Imagine you're designing a house and want to see how the rooms look before construction is complete. Expo Go is like a 3D walkthrough app that lets you see changes in real-time as you design. For app developers, instead of waiting hours to test every change on a mobile phone, Expo Go shows updates instantly on the device as the code changes.
